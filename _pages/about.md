I am a Lecturer in the Department of English at Changshu Institute of Technology, China, passionate about exploring how language comes alive in classrooms. 

I earned my PhD in Applied Linguistics from the University of Liverpool, following an MPhil in Second Language Education from the University of Cambridge and a BA in English in Education (First-Class with Distinction) from the University of York.

My research blends classroom inquiry with psycholinguistics, focusing on the cognitive and behavioral intricacies of young language learners. Iâ€™m particularly fascinated by the nuanced ways they process and respond to feedback in real-world educational settings.
